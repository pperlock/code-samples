Introduction
This repo is a collection of small code samples taken from larger project. These are meant to be used as a reference for my coding style and ability.

Each folder contains a README.md file that explains the code and how it was used in the project. I've also included comments throughout the code to explain what is happening.

I've removed any sensitive or proprietary information from the code.
